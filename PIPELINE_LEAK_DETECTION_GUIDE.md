# Pipeline Leak Detection Using DAS - Comprehensive Guide

## Understanding Our DAS Pipeline Monitoring System

### What is DAS Pipeline Monitoring?

Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) for our pipeline monitoring works by:

1. **Fiber Optic Installation:**
   - Fiber optic cable installed along our pipeline (buried or attached)
   - Cable acts as thousands of virtual microphones
   - Each "measurement point" represents ~4m of our pipeline

2. **Leak Detection Physics:**
   - Oil leaks create pressure waves and vibrations
   - These disturbances travel through the ground and pipe
   - DAS detects these acoustic signatures

3. **Our Data Structure:**
   - Time samples: 1000 measurements (likely 1000 seconds at 1 Hz)
   - Spatial points: 10,000 locations along ~41 km pipeline
   - Each value: Acoustic intensity at that time/location

4. **Typical Leak Signatures:**
   - Sudden amplitude increases at leak location
   - Pressure waves propagating along pipeline
   - Frequency content in 1-100 Hz range
   - Spatial correlation changes near leak
