DAS ANOMALY DETECTION - NEXT STEPS GUIDE
=======================================

This guide outlines the recommended steps to understand your DAS data better 
and implement effective anomaly detection.

STEP 1: DEEP DATA EXPLORATION
-----------------------------
Run the data explorer to understand your data patterns:
"""

def step1_data_exploration():
    """
    GOAL: Understand your data's characteristics, patterns, and structure
    
    RUN THIS COMMAND:
    python code/data_explorer.py
    
    WHAT IT DOES:
    - Loads all your CSV files
    - Analyzes temporal patterns (how data changes over time)
    - Analyzes spatial patterns (how data varies across distance)
    - Detects basic statistical anomalies
    - Creates comprehensive visualizations
    - Generates a detailed report
    
    WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
    - Are there periodic patterns in your data?
    - Do certain spatial locations show more variation?
    - Are there obvious outliers or unusual patterns?
    - How similar are the different files to each other?
    
    TIME NEEDED: ~5-10 minutes (depending on data size)
    """
    pass

def step2_anomaly_detection():
    """
    GOAL: Apply multiple anomaly detection algorithms to find unusual patterns
    
    RUN THIS COMMAND:
    python code/anomaly_detector.py
    
    WHAT IT DOES:
    - Preprocesses your data (normalization, smoothing)
    - Applies statistical methods (Z-score, IQR, Modified Z-score)
    - Uses machine learning methods (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM)
    - Performs PCA-based reconstruction error detection
    - Uses clustering-based detection (DBSCAN)
    - Detects temporal anomalies with sliding windows
    - Combines methods using ensemble voting
    - Creates detailed visualizations for each method
    
    WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
    - Which method finds the most relevant anomalies?
    - Are anomalies clustered in time or space?
    - Do different methods agree on the same anomalies?
    - What's the typical anomaly rate in your data?
    
    TIME NEEDED: ~10-15 minutes per file
    """
    pass

def step3_advanced_analysis():
    """
    GOAL: Dive deeper into specific aspects of your data
    
    RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:
    
    A) FREQUENCY DOMAIN ANALYSIS:
       - Apply FFT to identify frequency-based anomalies
       - Look for unusual spectral patterns
    
    B) CORRELATION ANALYSIS:
       - Find spatial correlations between measurement points
       - Identify propagating disturbances
    
    C) CHANGE POINT DETECTION:
       - Detect sudden changes in data characteristics
       - Identify regime changes
    
    D) DOMAIN-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS:
       - What type of physical system is this DAS monitoring?
       - Are there known patterns you should look for?
       - What constitutes a "real" anomaly vs. noise?
    """
    pass

def step4_validation_and_tuning():
    """
    GOAL: Validate and tune your anomaly detection system
    
    KEY QUESTIONS TO ADDRESS:
    
    1. GROUND TRUTH:
       - Do you have labeled anomalies to validate against?
       - Can domain experts help identify true vs. false positives?
    
    2. PARAMETER TUNING:
       - Adjust thresholds based on your tolerance for false positives
       - Tune contamination rates for ML methods
       - Optimize window sizes for temporal detection
    
    3. PERFORMANCE METRICS:
       - Calculate precision, recall, F1-score if you have labels
       - Measure computational efficiency for real-time use
       - Assess interpretability of results
    """
    pass

def step5_production_deployment():
    """
    GOAL: Deploy your anomaly detection system for operational use
    
    CONSIDERATIONS:
    
    1. REAL-TIME PROCESSING:
       - Can your system process new data as it arrives?
       - What's the acceptable detection latency?
    
    2. SCALABILITY:
       - How will the system handle larger datasets?
       - Can it process multiple files simultaneously?
    
    3. ALERTING AND VISUALIZATION:
       - How should anomalies be reported?
       - What visualizations help operators understand results?
    
    4. CONTINUOUS LEARNING:
       - How will the system adapt to changing data patterns?
       - When should models be retrained?

# IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN
print("""
ðŸš€ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS FOR YOUR DAS ANOMALY DETECTION PROJECT:

1. FIRST (5 minutes): Install required packages
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. SECOND (10 minutes): Run comprehensive data exploration
   python code/data_explorer.py
   
   This will give you crucial insights into your data patterns!

3. THIRD (15 minutes): Run anomaly detection on sample file
   python code/anomaly_detector.py
   
   This will show you what different algorithms detect as anomalies.

4. FOURTH (30 minutes): Analyze the results
   - Look at the generated plots and statistics
   - Compare results from different methods
   - Identify which anomalies look most relevant to your use case

5. FIFTH (60 minutes): Customize for your specific needs
   - Adjust parameters based on your domain knowledge
   - Focus on the most promising detection methods
   - Add domain-specific preprocessing if needed

ðŸ“Š KEY QUESTIONS TO ANSWER AFTER RUNNING THE ANALYSIS:

1. What do the temporal and spatial patterns tell you about your system?
2. Which anomaly detection method gives the most meaningful results?
3. What percentage of your data is flagged as anomalous? Is this reasonable?
4. Do the detected anomalies correspond to known events or issues?
5. How can you validate the accuracy of the detections?

ðŸŽ¯ SUCCESS METRICS:

- You understand the basic patterns in your DAS data
- You can identify the most suitable anomaly detection approach
- You have a baseline system that can detect unusual patterns
- You know how to tune the system for your specific requirements

ðŸ’¡ TIPS FOR SUCCESS:

1. Start simple - don't try to optimize everything at once
2. Visualize everything - plots reveal patterns that statistics miss
3. Domain knowledge is crucial - what should be considered anomalous?
4. Validate with experts - false positives can be worse than missed anomalies
5. Document your findings - you'll need to explain your approach to others
